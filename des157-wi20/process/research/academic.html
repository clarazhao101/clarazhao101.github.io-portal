      <p>For my final project, I want to focus on helping individuals struggling with Aspergers syndrome. According to WebMD, Aspergers syndrome is part of the broader category of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The condition is what doctors call a 'high-functioning' type of ASD, which sometimes makes the condition easier to overlook than more severe forms of ASD, preventing patients from getting the help and treatment they need.</p>

      <p>According to Healthline.com, changes in the brain are responsible for many of the symptoms of Aspergers syndrome. However, doctors have not been able to determine exactly what causes these changes. Genetic factors and exposure to environmental toxins, such as chemicals or viruses, have been identified as potential contributors to the development of the disorder, and boys are more likely to develop Aspergers syndrome than girls.</p>

      <p>According to Austismspeaks.org, typical symptoms of Aspergers include difficulty with social interaction, restricted interests, and desire for sameness. In fact, some of the earliest symptoms of Aspergers syndrome include missing social cues that seem obvious to other people, like body language or the expressions on people's faces. For instance, a person with Aspergers syndrome may not register that when somebody crosses his arms and scowls, he's angry. In addition, the individual may talk about himself most of the time and intensely focus on a single subject. As a result, they often have difficulty with give and take in conversation.</p>

      <p>Their lack of social skills often adds a lot of difficulty in the lives of Aspergers patinets, from simple misunderstanding/miscommunication, perceived weirdness by other people, and even bullying. According to Forbes, autistic children were three times more likely than neurotypical kids to be bullied in the past three months, and almost two thirds of autistic children had been bullied at some point in their lives.  For this and other reasons, Aspergers patients are also more susceptible to a other mental conditions including anxiety and depression disorders.</p>

      <p>There is no known cure for Aspergers syndrome but there are a variety of treatment options currently used for patients including psychological therapy, medications, speech and language therapy, and art and music therapy. According to Healthline.com, common psychological therapy options include behavioral therapy, which can help to address conditions like anxiety, depression, and other psychological challenges facing someone with Aspergers; social skills training, which can help someone with Aspergers understand social and conversation cues and help them to interact with others more effectively; physical or occupational therapy, which can help to improve motor skills in people with Aspergers that have problems with coordination; and family therapy, which can help parents or family members of someone with Aspergers learn how to interact with them in a positive way that promotes things like good social and living skills.</p>
