    <h3>Touch and Learn - Emotions</h3>

      <div class="summarybox">
        <p>In this app, kids view four images and hear an emotion word such as 'happy' or 'tired'. They will then tap on the image that matches the spoken emotion.</p>
        <p>I think this app is extremely effective for its target audience because autistic individuals tend to struggle with sensory overload, and this app does a great job of limiting the content the user is presented with and deliberately focusing in on just 4 pictures. This also gives the user the clue to navigate by clicking on the images. The app also provides choices to let users prioritize their own pathways by letting the user zone in and focus on certain emotions.</p>
        <p>However, one drawback to this app is that many of the images can be interpreted as different emotions, even to non-autistic people. Therefore, this app fails to convey the nuanced nature of human emotions, which may actually mislead autistic children into accepting an over simplified view of human emotion.</p>

    <h3>The Mood Meter</h3>
    <div class="bigcontainer">
      <div class = "picturebox">

      </div>

      <div class="summarybox">
        <p>This app helps kids reflect on and manage emotions. It collects information from users by having kids explore a grid of emotions to describe their current mood, and also giving them 150 characters to describe the situation that led to that mood. Later, kids can look back on past moods through both big picture views and detailed reports.</p>
        <p>This way of collecting information is highly effective for autistic children because it limits the choices and gives guidance instead of asking them to simply input their emotions on their own, which may be stressful to autistic kids who struggle to make sense of what they are feeling. It also gives kids the option of choosing their pathways, either by ending at describing the situation or by continuing and seeing strategies to shift their mood. In addition, it uses lots of arrows to give users visual cues of how to navigate and where to click.</p>
        <p>The only drawback to this may be that sometimes the choices of emotions and coping strategies may be limited, so it may benefit from giving users the option of creating their own.</p>
