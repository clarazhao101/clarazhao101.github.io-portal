        <p>The brainstorming really helped me get all my thoughts onto paper and find the connections between all these thoughts and ideas. The most interesting idea I had was finding a way to help people suffering from autism and Aspergers syndrome with social interactions.</p>
        <p>I know that people suffering from these conditions often struggle with social situations and are often misinterpreted by others. This is usually because people with these conditions tend to be hyperfocussed on a few topics of interest and have trouble reading social cues. Therefore, in conversations they tend to only talk about their topics of interest and fail to have meaningful exchanges with other people about other subjects.</p>
        <p> This process has led me to the idea of creating an app that helps autism/Aspergers patients reflect on their social interactions in order to build up mindfulness about reading social cues during conversations.</p>
        <p>Hopefully the app can help these people have more meaningful conversations with others and build up their social skills overtime.</p>
