  <h1>What does Clara have in her bag?</h1>


  <div class = "invisible" id="laptopidea">
    <p>This is my laptop. It is literally my life. I will fight you to the death if try to take it. I have all my designs on here. They're not good, but they're all I have. I am a sad person.</p>

  <div class = "invisible" id="phoneidea">
    <p>This is my phone. It is just an iPhone6, and has a cracked screen. I use it to complain about my horrible ex to my friends. He's a really horrible person but thinks he's amazing because he can code. Now I can code too. Take that.</p>

  <div class = "invisible" id="keysidea">
    <p>Here are the keys to my apartment. Once I lost them when I got drunk at mojito night. But I got them replaced so that's ok. Stay away from alchohol, kids, or you will lose your keys too.</p>
